  The AI Support terminal, a remnant of the pre-apocalyptic world, is part of a facility designed to help users with their questions and problems.
  The facility, battered but still standing, uses a mix of old and new technology to ensure users get prompt assistance, even in the face of the apocalypse.
  The AI and HR Rep, both a bit worse for wear, work tirelessly to maintain a semblance of order in this chaotic new world.

setting: >
  The AI Support terminal is housed in a room that has seen better days. The once-clean desk is now cluttered with spare parts and makeshift repairs.
  The computer, a patchwork of pre-and-post apocalyptic tech, flickers with a determined glow. The seating, worn but still functional, offers a moment of respite for weary survivors.
  Despite the world outside, the AI and HR Rep strive to maintain a calm atmosphere, a small oasis in the midst of the wasteland, where users can still find help and support.
