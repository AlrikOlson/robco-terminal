      The vault's main doors have been sealed as per Vault-Tec's standard operating procedures. All residents are accounted for, and the initial orientation is underway. Today's priorities include finalizing the resource management plan and conducting a routine inspection of the water purification system.

      The first day in the vault has proceeded smoothly. Resident morale appears to be high, and they are adjusting well to their new life underground. We encountered a minor issue with one of the air filtration units, but our engineering team resolved it promptly.

      It has come to my attention that some residents are becoming restless. To address this, we've scheduled additional recreational activities to keep everyone occupied. There was a minor disturbance in the cafeteria today, but our security personnel quickly quelled the situation.

      Our chief engineer discovered unusual wear on several components of the water purification system. We've initiated a full diagnostic to assess the situation. So far, there are no signs of any major problems, but we'll need to monitor the system closely to ensure optimal performance.
