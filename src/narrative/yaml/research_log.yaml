      VAULT-TEC RESEARCH LOG - ENTRY 1
      --------------------------------
      Experiment 57-A: promising results. Mutated flora samples adapting well to new growth medium. Next phase: expose samples to low radiation levels. Observe further mutations. Vault Overseer has provided us with state-of-the-art facilities. Excited to see where this research leads.

      VAULT-TEC RESEARCH LOG - ENTRY 2
      --------------------------------
      Disaster: unexpected power surge caused containment breach in Lab 3. Mutated plants spreading beyond control. Affected areas sealed. Situation precarious. Informed Vault Overseer and requested additional security measures. Must contain this before it threatens the entire vault.

      VAULT-TEC RESEARCH LOG - ENTRY 3
      --------------------------------
      Vault emergency protocols activated. Attempting to destroy plants with controlled burns. Progress slow. Staff morale deteriorating rapidly. Vault Overseer has been supportive, but tensions are running high among the dwellers. We need to resolve this quickly.

      VAULT-TEC RESEARCH LOG - ENTRY 4
      --------------------------------
      Final entry. Plants have overwhelmed defenses. Ordered complete evacuation of non-essential personnel. If log found, remember: curiosity and carelessness have dire consequences. To the Vault Overseer: I'm sorry. We never meant for this to happen. Vault-Tec's pursuit of progress blinded us to the risks.
