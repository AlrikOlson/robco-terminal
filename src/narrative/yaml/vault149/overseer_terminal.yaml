      The situation in Sector 4 is escalating. The medical team is struggling to find a cause or cure. I've ordered a lockdown to contain the spread. We can't let this jeopardize the entire vault.

      I've made a terrible mistake. The experiment has gone too far. The residents are not just sick; they're changing. Becoming something else. I've sealed off Sector 4, but I fear it's too late. God help us all.
